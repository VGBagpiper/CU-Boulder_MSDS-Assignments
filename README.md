# Mother_Ship

I'm learning R, Python, and relearning SQL, after many years away from coding. I'm undertaking the Expressway to Data Science courses from University of Colorado, Boulder, with the intent of applying to the Master of Data Science program.

This is my repository for my finished assignments for the program.
